# CollapseNerf

Changes collapse on enemy entities so that it can no longer deal more than 10% (configurable) of your maximum health as damage.

This is to counteract enemies with high fire rates dealing unfair levels of damage by inflicting many stacks of collapse at once. Enemies that inflict fewer stacks tend to hit harder anyway.
