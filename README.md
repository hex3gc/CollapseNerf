# CollapseNerf

Changes collapse on enemy entities so that a single stack can no longer deal more than 20% (configurable) of a player's maximum health as damage.

This is to normalize the level of damage coming from enemies' collapse effects, as in Vanilla it can feel significantly overtuned and inconsistent due to the difference in enemies' base damage. Intended for use with [Nautilus](https://thunderstore.io/package/hex3/Nautilus/) where voidtouched enemies are more common.
