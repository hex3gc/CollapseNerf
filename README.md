# CollapseNerf

Changes collapse on enemy entities so that it can no longer deal more than 20% (configurable) of your maximum health as damage.

This is to normalize the level of damage coming from different enemies' collapse effects, as in Vanilla it is significantly overtuned. Intended for use with [Nautilus](https://thunderstore.io/package/hex3/Nautilus/) where voidtouched enemies are far more common.
